## <%= name %>

This is a crawler created using the [Crabfarm framework](http://crabfarm.io/#/teaser). It is composed of navigators which allow you to access different sections of a website to extract infomation or perform actions.

To learn more about how this crawler was put together read the [documentation](http://github.com/platanus/crabfarm-gem).

### Deploy

To deploy <%= name %> first you must have an active account for the [Crabfarm Grid](https://grid.crabfarm.io).

If you already have an account, simply do:
```shell
crabfarm p
```

This will ask you for you credentials if it haven't and upload it to the grid.

### Use

To use the crawler from Ruby you can install cangrejo-gem:

```
gem install 'cangrejo'
```

and then

```ruby
require 'cangrejo'
Cangrejo.connect 'org/repo' do |session|
  session.navigate(:navigator_name, parameter_name: 'hello')
end
```

For more information, visit the [cangrejo-gem repository](https://github.com/platanus/cangrejo-gem).

If you prefer NodeJS instead, there is [Camaron](https://github.com/platanus/camaron)
